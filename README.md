# ðŸ§  Day 34 â€“ CS50 SQL + UFC Data Project (Visual Storytelling Focus)

Today marks a major milestone â€” I'm officially over **50% done** with the CS50â€™s Introduction to Databases with SQL course! While no SQL queries were written today, I shifted focus to something equally critical: **data storytelling**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Focus of the Day
I took the data Iâ€™ve collected for my **UFC predictive analytics project** and began working on how best to present it visually. Data analysis isnâ€™t just about queries â€” itâ€™s about delivering **insights that people can understand**.

### ðŸ“Š What I Did
- Developed a **visual animation prototype** that turns raw fight data into an engaging visual story.
- Practiced effective **data communication techniques** â€” clarity, flow, and visual hierarchy.
- Explored how analysts present data in a way that is **both engaging and informative**.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaway
> The ability to **tell a story with data** is just as important as writing perfect queries. Itâ€™s what turns numbers into *narratives* that drive decisions.
